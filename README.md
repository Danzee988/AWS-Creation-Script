# AWS-Creation-Script
The main purpose of this script is to automate the use of the AWS services. The script creates a new ec2 instance and an s3 bucket which both contain a website with some information. The script also sets up an email subscription. Finally the script runs a monitoring script on the instance gathering some information about thing like network usage.
